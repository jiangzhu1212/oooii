This folder contains prebuilt versions of software that is also built by this 
very system, but since it is used in the system it is provided as pre-built 
binaries. Doing so shields against a bad build where because of the error the 
build itself cannot complete and also allows the use of faster release-built
binaries even in debug builds.
