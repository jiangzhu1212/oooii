This folder contains prebuilt versions of software that is also built by this 
very system, but since it is used in the system it is provided as pre-built 
binaries. Doing so shields against a bad build where because of the error the 
build itself cannot complete and also allows the use of faster release-built
binaries even in debug builds.

NOTE: verpatch.exe is not a virus. It's purpose IS to modify the exe's 
details, so by design it will do something that an anti-virus app would find 
disagreeable. For a build environment, put verpatch.exe in the exceptions 
list in the anti-virus app.
