=== The Ouroboros Libraries ===

This is the foundation library for the coding efforts at OOOii.
(http://www.oooii.com)

The libraries contains fundamental interfaces for typical efforts in advanced 
video and 3D graphics as well as high throughput and multi-threaded programming. 
OOOii periodically refreshes this from time to time, usually after a project-
related QA push. This code is in active development so there are bugs, APIs and 
semantics may change, and the documentation is still on the yet-to-do list.

Our understanding is that all external source code, specifically FreeImage, 
Intel TBB, Bullet Physics, and TLSF are properly allowed to be used in this 
library. If a reader find this is not the case, please contact the author at 
antony.arciuolo@oooii.com.

All comments, feedback and recommendations on better implementations are welcome 
at either antony.arciuolo@oooii.com or arciuolo@gmail.com.

Enjoy!
