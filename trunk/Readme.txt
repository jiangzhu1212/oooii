=== The Ouroboros Libraries ===

This is the foundation library for the coding efforts at OOOii.
(http://www.oooii.com)

The libraries contains fundamental interfaces for typical efforts in 3D graphics 
and multi-threaded programming. The functionality of this library was originally
brought to the company by Antony Arciuolo, so to retain his rights to the 
software the company has agreed to contribute this library to the software
community under the liberal MIT license.

This code is in active development so there are bugs, APIs and semantics may 
change, and the documentation is still on the yet-to-do list.

All intentions are to get the primary source code under MIT. Our understanding 
is that all external source code, specifically FreeImage, Intel TBB, Bullet 
Physics, and TLSF are properly allowed to be used in this library. If a reader
find this is not the case, please contact the author at arciuolo@oooii.com.

All comments, feedback and recommendations on better implementations are welcome 
at arciuolo@gmail.com.

!!! NOTE !!!
oGfx and oGfxTest are BRAND NEW and are intended to be an external proof-of-
concept that the open-source version of Ouroboros is ready to be able to build a
renderer on top of it. The internal render is VERY different, distributed, cloud
-based, actually has features, etc. oGfx is done in my copious spare time, so 
its progress is underwhelming and mostly results in more internal work to 
Ouroboros itself.

So forgive oGfx for now, but everything else...

Enjoy!
