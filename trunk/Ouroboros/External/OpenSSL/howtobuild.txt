How to build OpenSSL-1.0.0e

Install Activestate perl
http://www.activestate.com/activeperl

32-bit:
- Open Visual Studio 2010 Command Prompt
- Navigate to the openssl-1.0.0e directory
> perl configure VC-WIN32 no-asm --prefix=c:/tmp_open_ssl
(note the forward slash, also not this directory does not seem to be used at all!)
> ms\do_ms.bat
> nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak
- When it is done, you will have a bunch of dlls, libs, and exes in a folder created in openssl-1.0.0e\out32dll

64-bit:
(Note: this will clobber 32-bit - best to do this on a fresh sync)
- Open Visual Studion 2010 x64 Cross Tools Command Prompt (note: this is a different command prompt than used above)
- Navigate to the openssl-1.0.0e directory
> perl configure VC-WIN64A
> ms\do_ms.bat
> nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak
- When it is done, you will have a bunch of dlls, libs, and exes in a folder created in openssl-1.0.0e\out32dll
(The dlls are still called 32, but they are 64-bit)
